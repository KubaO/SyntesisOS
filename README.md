# SyntesisOS
This is a collection of papers and code of Alexia (f. Henry) Massalin's SyntesisOS.

As far as I could find, the PDF of the thesis itself is now available from just one web page. Thus, Alexia's research is close to being closed off to easy search and download.

This repository's goal is to collect all extant papers and code related to SynthesisOS.

So far we've got:

- the thesis whose copyright belongs to Alexia,
- the draft of *The Synthesis Kernel* paper, whose copyright belongs to the authors,
- the published version of *The Synthesis Kernel* paper, whose copyright belongs to the publisher,
- the published version of *Superoptimizer -- A Look at the Smallest Program*, whose copyright belongs to the ACM.
